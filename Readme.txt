The "Old v1 (yuck)" folder contains the first project i wrote and is limited but the base of the code and you can use it to write your own filtering methods and addon to it from scratch... i left it so you could understand what was going on better with less coding.

The "New v3!" folder contains the newest project updated...

It has everything that Version2 (Which i didn't include cause of the zip size) has except a MUCH better filtering routine method that always works as far as i can tell. 

The newest feature in this version is that it can sort the listbox alphabetically and it's very helpful when used along with the Remove Dupes function.

Enjoy!
